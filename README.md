# Microdrop-Analysis

The Microdrop Analysis Tool is an R Shiny application that I developed at Eli Lilly & Company. The Microdrop assay is an experimental method that helps to reveal certain characteristics about antibodies, such as solution solubility. The app facilitates Microdrop analysis by automating the process of result capture, as well as providing visualizations for the user. 

The R script for the application is app.R, and the required supplmental script of functions sourced by the application is functions.R.

The original application is intended for usage by Eli Lilly scientists and is hosted on Eli Lilly's server. An open source version of this application can be found here: https://awalmer.shinyapps.io/microdrop_analysis/. Note: This version is hosted on shinyapps.io and has a 25 Active Hour limit per month.
